First repository, my obligatory "Hello World"

Hello all,

My name is Joshua Shackelford, a student in the Electrical Engineering department at the University of Washington. I have just started this github account and hope to fill it with the interesting projects and designs that I will be undertaking in my education. I hope this to be educational for myself, and maybe interest a few other people along the way!
